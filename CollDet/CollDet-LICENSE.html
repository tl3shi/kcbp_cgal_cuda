<h2>Copyright Notice and License Agreements</h2>

<p></b>Copyright &copy; 2007, Gabriel Zachmann.</b></p>
<p><b></b><br></p>

<h4>Copyright</h4>

The <i>CollDet Library</i> software (hereafter, <i>Software</i>), including
executable code, source code, and all other data, are intellectual
property of Mr. <i>Gabriel Zachmann</i> and <i>Clausthal University</I> (hereafter,
<i>GZ</i>) and ownership and copyright remains with GZ and Clausthal University
in all countries of the world.

<h4>Grant of Non-Commercial Use</h4>

GZ grants you (hereafter, <i>Licensee</i>) a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, royalty-free right to use
the Software, including any other data included with the
Software, for purely academic purposes
only, provided
<ol>
<li> this copyright notice / license appear in all copies of the
	Software, related documentation, </li>
<li> the Licensee makes sure that only persons that have signed this
	license agreement might obtain access to or use the Software, and </li>
<li> the Licensee does not distribute, or copy the Software or parts of it to
	any other person, nor any other storage over which he has not full control.
	</li>
</ol>
Any non-academic (hereafter, <i>commercial</i>) use of the Software
is forbidden without the express written permission of GZ and payment of
a license fee that is to be negotiated.
<P>

Note that a purely academic use also excludes use of the Software as a blue
print for your own commercial implementation, in-house installation for
"internal purposes" by a commercial institution, as well as storing the
Software on company computers, even if only "private" use is intended. In any
case, I do not allow the inclusion of the Software into any software that is
to be (re-)distributed in source-code format (unfortunately, this excludes
use of the Software within most open-source projects.)
<P>


<h4>Commercial Use</h4>

Any Licensee wishing to make commercial use of any part of the Software
should contact GZ to negotiate an appropriate license for such commercial
use. Commercial use includes (1) integration of any part of the Software
into a product for sale or license by or on behalf of Licensee to third
parties, or (2) distribution of any part of the Software to third parties
that need it to utilize a commercial product sold or licensed by or on
behalf of Licensee.

The fee for commercial or non-academic use is negotiable and could be anything
from a hardware donation to some money.


<h4>Modifications</h4>

Both under the non-commercial and the commercial license, Licensee is not
allowed to sub-license the Software or any derivative work based on or
derived from the Software.

<h4>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h4>

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. GZ DOES NOT
WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S
REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATIONS OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED
OR ERROR-FREE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOFTWARE IS WITH LICENSEE.

<h4>Limitation of Liability.</h4>

<b>IN NO EVENT SHALL <i>GZ</i> BE LIABLE IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS THE
LICENSE FEE PAID BY <i>Licensee</i> FOR ANY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITH
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS), REGARDLESS OF THE
FORM OF CLAIM OR ACTIONS, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
THE <i>Software</i> OR DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF <i>GZ</i> HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</b>

<h4>Right to Termination of License</h4>

GZ shall have the right to terminate this license immediately upon
Licencee's breach of or noncompliance with any of its terms. Licensee may
be held legally responsible for any copyright infringement that is caused
or encouraged by Licensee's failure to abide by the terms of this
license.

<h4>Address</h4>

Please print this copyright notice / license agreement, sign it (if you

representative sign it), put the
